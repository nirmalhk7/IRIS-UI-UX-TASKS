                    Lorem ipsum. Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city.

                    You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting.I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.

                    You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600. Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake. Speak of the devil, and he shall appear. Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it.

                    I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded. How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death. Yes. The fire rises. If you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."
